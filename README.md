# liri-node-app

## Application Overview

This CLI-driven app captures (two) inputs put in by the user, and responds appropriately. More use-cases could be developed, but the primary purpose for building this app was to familiarize myself with utilizing Node.js along with making API calls. 

### Technology used
* Node.js
* `twitter` npm package
* `node-spotify-api` npm package
* `dotenv` npm package

### How to Use
As of right now (September 29, 2018) the application only accepts two valid inputs; `my-tweets` and `spotify-this-song`.
